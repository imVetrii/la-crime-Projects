## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes crime data from Los Angeles, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and insights related to crime types, timing, and locations. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

 
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

GitHub

NBViewer (for better visualization of large notebooks)

## 📈 Objectives
Understand which hours and days have the most crimes

Identify the most common crime types

Explore geographical patterns of incidents (if applicable)

Support public safety planning through data insights


## 🔍 Key Insights
🕒 Crimes peak during 12am-1am

 📆 Certain days show higher incident rates

🚓 Theft and burglary are the most frequent crime categories

📍 Specific neighborhoods report more incidents



## 📊 Visualizations
Includes bar plots, line charts, and count summaries to highlight:

Hourly distribution of crimes

Frequency of crime types

Trends over time




## 🧠 What I Learned
Handling large datasets with Pandas

Time-based grouping and visualizing with dt.hour

Sharing large Jupyter notebooks using NBViewer

Telling a data story through visualization
